Please note that I've written a fair amount of this code with the assistance of an AI tool. If for some reason this code includes code that was previously written and licensed differently than the MIT license I slapped on there, I would very much appreciate it if you let me know by popping an issue on my repo - apologies for any incidental re-use!
